Dumbledore: [to the cat] I should have known that you would be here... Professor McGonagall.
[The cat turns into McGonagall.]
McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good and the bad.
McGonagall: And the boy?
Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.
McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Dumbledore: Ah, Professor. I would trust Hagrid with my life.
[Hagrid appears on a flying motorcycle]
Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. [hands Dumbledore a bundle – Harry] Try not to wake him. There you go.
[Dumbledore takes Harry and heads for the Dursleys]
McGonagall: Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day, they're the worst sort of... Muggles imaginable. They really are–
Dumbledore: The only family he has.
McGonagall: This boy will be famous! There won't be a child in our world that doesn't know his name!
Dumbledore: Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that... until he is ready. [Dumbledore places Harry on the doorstep. Hagrid snivels.] There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. [Hagrid nods. Dumbledore places a letter on Harry.] Good luck... Harry Potter.
